## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: (LTS version recommended, e.g., 18.x or 20.x) - The JavaScript runtime environment.
- **pnpm**: (Performant Node.js Package Manager) - Used for installing and managing project dependencies. You can install it globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

- **Supabase Project**: An active Supabase project with your database, authentication, and storage configured. You will need your Supabase Project URL and Public API Key (Anon Key) for the .env file. If you haven't set one up, you can do so at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/KickOffGear.git
cd KickOffGear
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file: Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project directory (where `package.json` is located) and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase project credentials.

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_PUBLIC_ANON_KEY
# If you have any other environment variables, add them here.
# For example, if you need a service role key for server-side operations (be cautious with this in client-side code):
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

> **Note**: You can find your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your Supabase project dashboard under **Project Settings > API**.
